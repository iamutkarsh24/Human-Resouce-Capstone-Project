## About the Project üöÄ
This project is a Human Resources (HR) analytics capstone. It involves analyzing employee-related data to uncover insights about workforce demographics, employee satisfaction, recruitment trends, performance metrics, and attrition patterns.
The dashboard is designed for HR managers and executives to make data-driven decisions aimed at improving employee retention, hiring strategies, and overall organizational health.

## Objectives of the Project üéØ
- To analyze key HR metrics such as employee demographics, attrition rates, job satisfaction, recruitment processes, and performance ratings.
- To identify patterns and insights that can help reduce employee turnover, enhance employee satisfaction, and optimize recruitment efforts. 
- To support strategic HR planning through the visualization of historical trends and current workforce characteristics. 

## Dataset Source üíø
- Kaggle sourced the dataset used in this project. 

## Domain üì∫
- The domain of this project is Human Resource Management

## Tools ‚öíÔ∏è
- Power BI is used to clean and visualise the data

## Findings üìä
From the visualizations and data provided:
- **Attrition Rate:** A noticeable proportion of employees leave the organization, with higher attrition among certain job roles (like Sales and Research departments).
- **Demographic Patterns:**
  - A higher attrition rate among younger employees and those with lower years at the company.
  - Male employees form a slightly higher portion of the workforce.
- **Job Satisfaction:**
  - Employees with lower job satisfaction scores have a higher tendency to leave.
  - Work-life balance and relationship satisfaction also show clear correlations with attrition rates.
- **Recruitment:**
  - The recruitment process appears to be favoring candidates with higher education levels and experience, but new hires often show higher early attrition.
- **Performance Ratings:**
  - Employees with average or low-performance ratings are more likely to leave or be terminated.

## Conclusion üöÄ
- Retention strategies need to be focused on younger employees and new hires to reduce early attrition.
- Improving job satisfaction and work-life balance can significantly impact employee retention.
- Targeted interventions such as mentorship programs for new employees and career development opportunities can help mitigate the risk of attrition.
- Recruitment processes should be evaluated not just for qualifications but also for cultural fit and long-term engagement potential
- Data-driven HR policies can enhance organizational stability and boost employee morale.
